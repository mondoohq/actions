# Mondoo GitHub Organization Action

A GitHub Action for using Mondoo to scan a GitHub Organization for security misconfigurations such as branch protection, CI tests, required code-review, and more. This Action can be used to audit individual GitHub repositories. This Action can be easily used in [.github or .github-private](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile) repositories.

## Permissions

Depending on the amount that should be covered, you need to provide the proper permissions to the token. Since Mondoo only reads values, only read only permissions are required.

| Permission     | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| read:org       | e.g. required to verify GitHub organizations                                                 |
| admin:org_hook | e.g. required to verify that all hooks use https                                             |
| repo           | Ability to read configuration, required since GitHub does not provide a repo:read permission |
| workflow       | eg. allows the verification of workflow settings                                             |
| read:packages  | e.g. allows to verify that packages are not public                                           |

## Properties

The GitHub Organization Action has properties which are passed to the underlying image. These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property                      | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
