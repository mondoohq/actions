# Mondoo GitHub Organization Action

A GitHub Action for using Mondoo to scan a GitHub Organization for security misconfigurations such as branch protection, CI tests, required code-review, and more. This Action can be used to audit individual GitHub repositories. This Action can be easily used in [.github or .github-private](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile) repositories.

**_Organizations with a large number of repositories (20+) are likely to hit GitHub's API Rate Limit causing this action to fail. Please refer to the 'Using App Tokens' section below!_**

## Permissions

Depending on the amount that should be covered, you need to provide the proper permissions to the token. Since Mondoo only reads values, only read only permissions are required.

| Permission     | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| read:org       | e.g. required to verify GitHub organizations                                                 |
| admin:org_hook | e.g. required to verify that all hooks use https                                             |
| repo           | Ability to read configuration, required since GitHub does not provide a repo:read permission |
| workflow       | eg. allows the verification of workflow settings                                             |
| read:packages  | e.g. allows to verify that packages are not public                                           |

## Properties

The GitHub Organization Action has properties which are passed to the underlying image. These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property                      | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organization`                | true     |         | GitHub organization to scan eg. `mondoohq`.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `log-level`                   | false    | info    | Sets the log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")                                                                                                                                                             |
| `output`                      | false    | compact | Set the output format for scan results: compact, yaml, json, junit, csv, summary, full, report (default "compact")                                                                                                               |
| `score-threshold`             | false    | 0       | Sets the score threshold for scans. Scores that fall below the threshold will exit 1. (default "0" - job continues regardless of the score returned by a scan).                                                                  |
| `is-cicd`                     | false    | true    | Flag to disable the auto-detection for CI/CD runs. If deactivated it reports into the Fleet view                                                                                                                                 |

## Scan GitHub organization

You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: Scan GitHub organization
on: push

jobs:
  scan-github-org:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: mondoohq/actions/github-org@v1.0.0
        env:
          MONDOO_CONFIG_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MONDOO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          organization: ${{ GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER }}
```

## Using App Tokens

GitHub implements an [aggressive API rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting) which will impact organizational scans for orgs with a large number of repositories. Normal access tokens are limited to 5,000 requests per hour. By using a GitHub App Token you can increase this limit to 15,000 per hour.

To leverage an App Token:

1. As a GitHub Organization Owner, go to your Organizational Settings and then under "Developer Settings" select "GitHub Apps". The URL is `https://github.com/organizations/<org_name>/settings/apps`
2. Click the _New GitHub App_ button
3. Name the app what ever you like, we suggest "Mondoo Org Scan (Internal)" and give it a description
4. Set the _Homepage URL_ to anything, we suggest "https://mondoo.com"
5. Uncheck the "Active" button under "Webhook".
6. Set the permissions for your Repo, Org and Account to allow Mondoo to scan the resources.
7. Select the "Only on this account" button and then click "Create GitHub App" to finish.
8. Record the App ID, then scroll down and click the "Generate a private key" button. This will download the private key that you will use later.
9. Now, click "Install App" and then "Install" next to the Org your planning to scan. You can choose All Repositories or only the rep running this action, then click "Install".
10. Finally, update your action to include the github-app-token action and use it's output token. This will require you to add the Apps ID and Private Key to Action Secrets. The new action will look like:

```
# ....
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Generate token
        id: generate_token
        uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v1
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
          private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - uses: mondoohq/actions/github-org@v0.9.3
        env:
          MONDOO_CONFIG_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MONDOO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate_token.outputs.token }}
        with:
          organization: <YOUR_ORGANIZATION>
          is-cicd: false
```
