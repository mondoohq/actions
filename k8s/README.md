# Mondoo Kubernetes Cluster Action
A GitHub Action for using Mondoo to scan Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. This Action can be used as a post-deploy job to provide continuous auditing of your cluster. This action requires a valid `KUBECONFIG` with access to the cluster(s) to be scanned. 

For Kubernetes manifest scanning see Mondoo's [k8s-manifest](../k8s-manifest/) action.

## Properties

The Kubernetes Cluster Action has properties which are passed to the underlying image. These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property                      | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `args`                        | false    |         | Additional arguments to pass to Mondoo Client.                                                                                                                              |
| `log-level`                   | false    | info    | Sets the log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")                                                                                                 |
| `output`                      | false    | compact | Set the output format for scan results: compact, yaml, json, junit, csv, summary, full, report (default "compact")                                                   |
| `score-threshold`             | false    | 0       | Sets the score threshold for scans. Scores that fall below the threshold will exit 1. (default "0" - job continues regardless of the score returned by a scan).      |
| `service-account-credentials` | true     |         | Base64 encoded [service account credentials](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/service_accounts/#creating-service-accounts) used to authenticate with Mondoo Platform |
